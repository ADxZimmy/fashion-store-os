## Current Focus

Phase 2 backend persistence foundation is implemented and verified.

## Completed

- Initialized planning artifacts.
- Read Prompt 1 and extracted the deck direction.
- Confirmed referenced docs/assets are in `docs/`.
- Added static app shell in `index.html`.
- Added responsive theme and UI styling in `src/styles.css`.
- Added persistent local app logic, data models, onboarding, settings, and workflows in `src/app.js`.
- Verified onboarding, dashboard, order cutting/completion, inventory deduction, reserve release, learning records, and mobile layout.
- Accepted the GitHub collaborator invitation and connected the repo to `ADxZimmy/fashion-store-os`.
- Added project handover documentation.
- Replaced native browser dialogs with app-native modals.
- Persisted UI/UX Pro Max design-system guidance under `design-system/fashion-store-os/`.
- Added dependency-free Node backend serving static files and JSON persistence APIs.
- Wired frontend bootstrap/save/reset flows to backend storage with localStorage fallback.
- Restored true brand-agnostic first launch by requiring business setup when no profile exists.
- Added visible loading and storage-status UI.

## In Progress

- Item: None.

## Blocked

- Item: Production backend/database decision.
  Reason: Current slice starts with dependency-free JSON persistence so product flows can move before choosing cloud infrastructure.

## Next Action

Start the CRM channel intake phase for WhatsApp/Instagram-style inbound messages becoming CRM inbox inquiries.
